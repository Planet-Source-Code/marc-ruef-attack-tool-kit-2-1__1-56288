<bug_vulnerability_class>SQL Injection</bug_vulnerability_class>
<bug_description>The target ftp server seems to be running a version of Password Protect that is vulnerable to a SQL injection. An attacker may gain elevated privileges and completely compromise the target host.</bug_description>
<bug_solution>Install the patches for the affected version or upgrade to the latest software version. An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) may also be able to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities as like this one. The ftp server should be deactivated or de-installed if not necessary. To make it harder to find the server the daemon could be configured to listen at another port (e.g. 8081). Try to prevent unwanted connection attempts by filtering traffic with firewalling. Alternation of the application banner can confuse an attacker and let him determine the wrong software.</bug_solution>
